	<h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
	<h2>Why, I Love It?</h2>
	<p>I'm a person who adore engaging in relaxed, laid-back activities, often lounging around, binge-watching TV shows, or taking naps. I like to typically prioritize comfort and leisure, often making an art out of doing nothing strenuous or stressful.</p>
	<h2>How to get started?</h2>
<ol>
        <li><b>Acquire the Essentials:</b> Stock up on cozy blankets, oversized pillows, and a variety of snacks that can be eaten without having to move much (bonus points for anything that comes in a share-size bag).</li>
        <li><b>Dress Code:</b>  Invest in the comfiest loungewear possible. Think soft pajama pants, fluffy socks, and the kind of hoodie that feels like a warm hug from a cloud. Formal attire is strictly forbidden.</li>
        <li><b>Remote Control Command:</b>  Train your thumbs to be in peak physical condition for channel surfing. The remote is your scepter, and with great power comes great responsibility (mostly to find the next series to binge-watch).</li>
        <li><b>Procrastination Skills:</b>  Cultivate a strong sense of procrastination. Any form of productivity should be met with a firm “maybe later” attitude. Chilling is an all-day commitment.</li>
        <li><b>Stay Committed:</b>  Finally, stay dedicated to the cause. Remember, being a serial chiller isn't just a pastime—it's a lifestyle. Embrace every lazy moment, and wear your title with pride.</li>
</ol>
